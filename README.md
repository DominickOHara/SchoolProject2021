The grey needle represents Madame Defarge
The gold needle represents Lucie Manette

Whenever madame defarge kills the hearts, it represents
her manipulation on others in her attempt to kill 
the aristocracy in the french revolution

Whenever you (as Lucie) heal the hearts, it represents
the undoing of madame degarge's meadling with the characters in the book.
